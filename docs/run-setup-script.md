# Running the GPG Signed Commits Setup Script

This guide will walk you through how to run the `setup-gpg-signed-commits.sh` script to automatically set up GPG signed commits in your Git environment.

## Running the Script
The script automates the setup of GPG signed commits. To run the script, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
If you haven't already, clone the repository where the script is hosted:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/CloudAutomation-Hub/GPG-signed-commits-setup.git
```

### Step 2: Make the Script Executable
Ensure that the script has executable permissions. You can do this by running:

```sh
chmod +x setup-gpg-signed-commits.sh
```

### Step 3: Execute the Script
Run the script with the following command:

```sh
./setup-gpg-signed-commits.sh
```

### Step 4: Follow the Prompts
The script will guide you through the setup process. You'll be prompted for the following:

1. **GPG Key ID:** If you already have a GPG key, provide the key ID. If you don't have one, the script will help you generate it.

2. **GitHub Key Addition:** The script will automatically open your default web browser and take you to the GitHub GPG keys page to add your public GPG key. If the browser doesnâ€™t open, you'll be provided with a URL to open manually.

3. **Test Commit:** After setting up, the script will attempt to make a test commit to ensure that everything is working correctly.

### Step 5: Verify the Setup
Once the script completes, go to your GitHub account and verify that the commit is marked as "`Verified`" on the test repository.

## Troubleshooting
- **xdg-open:** command not found: If you're using WSL or Linux and the browser does not open automatically, you can manually open the GitHub GPG keys page by navigating to [GitHub GPG Keys Settings](https://github.com/settings/keys).

- **GPG Key Not Found:** If the script can't find your GPG key, make sure you've generated it and that you're using the correct key ID.
